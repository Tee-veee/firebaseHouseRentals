# marketPlaceApp

## marketPlaceApp
marketPlaceApp is just a basic UI designed for mobile that utilises fireBase as a backend so users can OAuth or Auth via email, upload house listings, edit housing listings and view available houses.

## why marketPlaceApp
to experiment with a firebase v9 and build my first basic backend project, this was a follow up to my TMDB project as I was curious about backends after familiarising myself with fetch API's and axios.

also a good chance to expirment with some other JS libraries like leaflet and toast.

## using marketPlaceApp
designed for mobile, however this is not a design project.
